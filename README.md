# Machine-Learning-Tasks

This is our group repo for assignments for machine learning course

Colaboration is easy when we use git and github, this repo is private so our work is safe and we need not worry about plagarism unless one of our group members decide to share our code, so we trust you, please dont do it, you are allowed to help your friends none the less with your knowledge but not with the code written by you or any of us for the purpose of the assignments.

## How to do the assignments

As per the informations available, most of the assignments will be assigned to do in python notebooks, so we can surely use google colab or local jupyter notebook. But google colab is better because of the cloud features and directly save to github features, and for better performance they can be connected to local jupyter runtime directly.

## How to collaborate

Each team member will work by creating a branch for each assignment so every one can work independently and the main branch always contains the final polished code. Creating your own branch will also help you better ask others for help and everyones work could be compiled into the final submission code.
When ever you want to build upon on someones else work just make a branch out of it with proper naming convention and latter merge it to your branch once done. This practices will be more helpful for bigger assignments and also help us get habituated to git and github.
While saving your colab file to github make sure to select the right branch and check `insert link to colab` option. Prevent your colab files to be edited accidently by others by keeping the sharing mode to edit and sharing only to the group members. Keep all the files for this course in specific folder and subfolders for better management. Use uniform convention for naming the files to prevent creation of duplicates.

### Branch Naming convention

For each assignment, I will initialise a repo with an empty notebook and the inital data files given, just create a branch out of the main branch with naming convention as `<name>-<assignment number in two digit>`, for example `divyansh-01`.
Never tamper someone else's branch and directly to main branch.

### Better collaboration

When discussing about specific code section etc use discussion forums and issues feature so its easy for others to work and check.
