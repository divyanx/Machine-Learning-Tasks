# Character Recognition

We have implemeted a hand written character recognition system using a Bayesian Classifier and Naive Bayes Classifier.

We have tried to adopt proper ML practices like undertsnding the data, visualizing the data, visualising the effects of various trasnformations on the data. Wed have used plots and heatmaps extensively to have a proper understanding of the data. We have also tried to use the data in a proper way to make it more interpretable. Our notebook is full of markdown and comments to help you understand the code. We have also included the basic theory behind the code.

Warning : The notebook is not optimized for speed at some points, We have mentioned it at places which might take longer to run. At max some cells 2 or 3 took 10 minuts to run.

## Our code include the following :
